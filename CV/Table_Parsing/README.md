# Table parsing
This code is heavily influenced from <b>https://medium.com/@djajafer/pdf-table-extraction-with-keras-retinanet-173a13371e89</b>. The major difference is that the mentioned link uses keras based RetinaNet object detection but this repository uses pytorch based retinanet implementation (<b>https://github.com/yhenon/pytorch-retinanet</b>)

The problem statement of detecting tables in pdf files is handled as an Object detection problem. One such CNN based model is <b>RetinaNet</b>. To understand how RetinaNet works, please go through the following blogs:
